If my alpha-beta works, it will be because I don't need to modify a variable in parent scope. I only need to compare. To compare, I can pass the variable from the parent scope as an argument in to the function for the current scope. After comparing, if I decide to break the for loop and stop looking at additional board states on that child level/scope, I can return something in the current scope.

If I somehow needed to continue looking at other board states while updating a variable in parent scope, that would be another question. More difficult. Maybe impossible. But now I'm thinkng of returning when wanting to update parent scope variable, and then continuning the for loop...
