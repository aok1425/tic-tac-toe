* No alpha-beta pruning
* I hardcoded computer's first move. I chose each one by having the computer think through the first move after I made a move.
* It doesn't choose the quickest way to win, but in those instances, it still wins. Must be an artifact of how the algorithm works.

## CSS
* Input type=image doesnâ€™t allow you to change CSS, so have to use type=button [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/195632/how-to-change-an-input-button-image-using-css](www.google.com)
* Using button, the circle has a background. if i play around w CSS more, i can remove that background, resize circle, and recenter it.

## Possible feature additions
* can add feature to have computer go first
